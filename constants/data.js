    description: [
      `I am a full stack software developer with 5+ years of experience in building and maintaining web and mobile applications. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java, and have experience working with frameworks such as React, vue, Node, Next Js. I have a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end development and am comfortable working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB`,

      `I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and hold certifications in web development from Coding Ninjas. I am passionate about building beautiful and responsive user interfaces, and I am always looking for new technologies and tools to improve my skills.`,

      `In my free time, I enjoy long walks on the beach... just kidding, I'm a full stack developer, I don't have free time! But when I do, I like to play video games, and I'm a big fan of open-source software. My idea of a perfect weekend is binge-watching Game of Thrones while coding up a storm. I'm also a fan of dad jokes, so feel free to share some with me. In fact, I'm so good at dad jokes, I could make an app for that, but that would be too easy.`,

      `When I'm not coding, I can usually be found in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes and trying to master the art of baking sourdough bread. I also enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors, but I prefer to do it with my laptop and a good internet connection. I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting projects to work on, so if you have any ideas, let me know!`,
